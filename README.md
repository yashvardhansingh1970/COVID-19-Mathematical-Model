# COVID-19-Mathematical-Model
# What is a mathematical model?
1. A mathematical model is a process of using a model in mathematics to visualise 
and solve a problem. 
2. Mathematical model allows students to analytical skills to solve a problem and 
visualise the results to understand better. 
3. Mathematical model requires conceptual understanding and mathematical 
precision.
4. Modelling presents problem-solving as a creative, iterative process as they 
support many possible justifiable answers.
# How does covid-19 spread?
SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread from person to person 
through droplets produced during coughing or breathing during close contact with 
an infected individual. Infection can also occur indirect contact when these 
droplets land on objects and surfaces around the infected individual and the other 
person touches these objects or surfaces, then touches their eyes, nose or mouth. 
This is why it is important to stay at least 1-2 meters (3-6 feet) away from a person 
who is sick. Given that some individuals have no symptoms while still infected with 
the virus, physical distancing of 1-2 meters should be observed regardless of 
whether the other person seems sick.
Using mathematical modelling we will analyse the impact of covid-19. 
By analysing the initial impact and how the spread effected the population. This 
will help us better understand and to predict the future events. The goal is to 
predict the number of infected persons in the future. This study will not only help 
us to understand the behaviour pattern for each country on how well they manage 
themselves during such events but also we can use similar experience to predict 
any future event big or small/large population size or small population size
# OBJECTIVE
Key objectives for Mathematical Model are: 
1. Understanding the change from the beginning of the epidemic to the final 
stages of covid-19.
2. Analysing the change in behaviour for each country on how they will 
approach towards this issue.
3. By understanding the measures each country takes we will study the 
magnitude of change in covid-19 cases. This study will guide us towards 
on how and why certain change can be seen.
4. After understanding the important factors affecting the change in infected 
population we will make predictions for future waves.
5. Individual response towards covid-19 (SIR model)
6. Human exhausted rate in which countries was higher?
7. Understanding why there is a change in infected population for each 
county? Which country was effected more? Reason for a rapid increase in 
a certain country? Does population of county will affect the number of 
infected persons?
8. Detailed study of epidemic, how thing works? Human reaction after 
second wave, importance of social distancing, lockdown, wearing masks, 
etc.
# COUNTRIES SELECTION and REASON:
The countries that we have selected are: Brazil, Japan and Nigeria.
If we talk about the countryâ€™s population then according to 
https://www.worldometers.info/
1. The population of Brazil is 216M
2. The population of Japan is 125M
3. The population of Nigeria is 217M
